## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) - For data visualization

### Continued development

I used Chart.js for the first time in completing this project. It appears to be a powerful data visualization tool, and I can't wait to use it more in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This well-documented reference website helped me efficiently transition from vanilla CSS to Tailwind CSS. It is a popular CSS framework that promotes increased efficiency in styling applications.

- [Chart.js Documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) - This helped me get started with Chart.js, from integrating with React.js to configuring different chart types.
